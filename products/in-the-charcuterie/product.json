We cook a lot, not just at The Fatted Calf but at home as well. The methods and recipes in this book are based on our professional experience of working in a charcuterie for over a decade--but they are also written with the home cook in mind. We want people to better understand the processes of charcuterie by participating in it. So we invite you to slip into our greasy clogs for just a little while, plunge your hands into a freshly ground farce to make sausage, inhale the intense perfume of a spice blend, confidently carve a roast and enjoy the delicious results of your labor.</span></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(If you would like a signed &amp; personalized version, select the signed version and specify the message you would like in the notes at checkout.)</span></strong></p>","vendor":"Ten Speed Press","product_type":"Books","created_at":"2016-02-29T17:22:43-08:00","handle":"in-the-charcuterie","updated_at":"2016-02-29T18:34:00-08:00","published_at":"2016-02-29T17:20:00-08:00","template_suffix":null,"published_scope":"global","tags":"merch","variants":[{"id":16304216902,"product_id":4886353542,"title":"Normal","price":"0.00","sku":"","position":1,"grams":0,"inventory_policy":"deny","compare_at_price":null,"fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":null,"option1":"Normal","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T17:22:43-08:00","updated_at":"2016-02-29T18:34:00-08:00","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"barcode":"","inventory_quantity":1,"old_inventory_quantity":1,"image_id":null,"weight":0,"weight_unit":"lb"},{"id":16306321734,"product_id":4886353542,"title":"Signed & Personalized","price":"0.00","sku":"","position":2,"grams":0,"inventory_policy":"deny","compare_at_price":null,"fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":null,"option1":"Signed & Personalized","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T18:34:00-08:00","updated_at":"2016-02-29T18:34:00-08:00","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"barcode":"","inventory_quantity":1,"old_inventory_quantity":1,"image_id":null,"weight":0,"weight_unit":"lb"}],"options":[{"id":6011827398,"product_id":4886353542,"name":"Version","position":1,"values":["Normal","Signed & Personalized"]}],"images":[{"id":9854004998,"product_id":4886353542,"position":1,"created_at":"2016-02-29T17:22:46-08:00","updated_at":"2016-02-29T17:22:46-08:00","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1177/6072/products/The_Book.jpg?v=1456795366","variant_ids":[]}],"image":{"id":9854004998,"product_id":4886353542,"position":1,"created_at":"2016-02-29T17:22:46-08:00","updated_at":"2016-02-29T17:22:46-08:00","src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1177/6072/products/The_Book.jpg?v=1456795366","variant_ids":[]}}
