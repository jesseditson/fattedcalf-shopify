<p><b>Welcome To The Fatted Calf</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk through our doors and it feels as if you’ve entered a secret world of meaty wonders. The aroma of a crispy-skinned pork roast fills the shop, inviting you to try a bite. Our cases are filled with pâtés, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">salumi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sausages, roasts, and terrines--and when the meat counter crew offers you a slice of the fennel-flecked Sbriciolona and a piece of headcheese, it’s hard to say no. Walk back into our kitchen and you’ll smell spices toasting, bones roasting, and broths simmering. Andres is churning out coils of fresh sausage from the hand-cranked stuffer, and Ren is hanging huge, freshly-cased Cotechino on hooks for fermentation. We’re hand-shredding a veritable vat of duck rillettes, seasoning it with freshly chopped thyme, then packing it into jars and sealing each with a creamy layer of duck fat. Bacon has just finished in the smoker! Go ahead and tear a hot piece off the end of the glistening slab. Peer into our curing room where row upon row of salami, guanciale, and pancetta hang quietly, patiently, enrobed in a delicate snowy bloom of mold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are curious and want to know how all of this works--if a hunger stirs inside of you and you feel somehow strangely at home--then you are in the right place. Welcome to the Fatted Calf Charcuterie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A charcuterie is a bit of a strange business, and the Fatted Calf is an unusual charcuterie. More than just a butcher shop, we offer meaty goods and services that are varied and unique. Pick out a duck or a slab of ribs and we’ll cook it up for you. Want us to wrap and season your pork tenderloin? No problem. Craving a dish you ate at a little roadside restaurant in Burgundy and need wads of lacy caul fat and pork jowl to recreate it? We have it here. At the Fatted Calf, we butcher whole hogs, goats, and lamb. We sell chicken, duck, rabbit, and quail. We make our own sausage, pâtés, terrines, and potted meats. We cure salumi, smoke pastrami, and roast porchetta. We think about, talk about, and share our love of good meat from the moment we open until we close each day. We also teach butchery and charcuterie-making classes because we want to pass on the knowledge we’ve acquired to you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its most basic level, charcuterie is the technique of seasoning, processing, and preserving meat. But it is also a way of preserving food cultures and traditions, and enriching our daily habit of breaking bread. It is a holistic approach to cooking and eating meat and a rewarding, hands-on way to connect with our food. At the Fatted Calf, charcuterie is a way of life--an approach to cooking and eating that celebrates the pleasures of the table.  </span></strong></p>
