//  Sass extends the CSS @import rule to allow it to import SCSS and Sass files. All imported SCSS
//  and Sass files will be merged together into a single CSS output file.
//  In addition, any variables or mixins defined in imported files can be used in the main file.
//  Sass looks for other Sass files in the current directory, and the Sass file directory under Rack, Rails, or Merb.
//  Additional search directories may be specified using the :load_paths option, or the --load-path option on the command line.
//  @import takes a filename to import. By default, it looks for a Sass file to import directly,
//  but there are a few circumstances under which it will compile to a CSS @import rule:

//    If the fileâ€™s extension is .css.
//    If the filename begins with http://.
//    If the filename is a url().
//    If the @import has any media queries.

//  If none of the above conditions are met and the extension is .scss or .sass, then the named Sass or SCSS file will be imported.
//  If there is no extension, Sass will try to find a file with that name and the .scss or .sass extension and import it.

//  For example,
//    @import "foo.scss";

//  or
//    @import "foo";
